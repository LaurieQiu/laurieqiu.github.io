[U2 - Where The Streets Have No Name](https://youtu.be/GzZWSrr5wFI)

I wanna run, I want to hide <br /> 
I wanna tear down the walls  <br /> 
That hold me inside <br /> 
I wanna reach out <br /> 
And touch the flame <br /> 
Where the streets have no name

I wanna feel sunlight on my face  <br /> 
I see the dust-cloud <br /> 
Disappear without a trace <br /> 
I wanna take shelter <br /> 
From the poison rain <br /> 
Where the streets have no name

Where the streets have no name<br /> 
Where the streets have no name <br /> 
We're still building and burning down love <br />  
Burning down love <br /> 
And when I go there <br /> 
I go there with you  <br /> 
It's all I can do <br /> 

The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust  <br /> 
We're beaten and blown by the wind  <br /> 
Trampled in dust <br /> 
I'll show you a place <br /> 
High on a desert plain, yeah <br /> 
Where the streets have no name, ah-ha

Where the streets have no name <br /> 
Where the streets have no name <br /> 
We're still building and burning down love <br />  
Burning down love <br /> 
And when I go there <br /> 
I go there with you <br /> 
It's all I can do <br /> 

Our love turns to rust <br /> 
We're beaten and blown by the wind <br />  
Blown by the wind <br /> 
Oh and I see love <br /> 
See our love turn to rust <br /> 
We're beaten and blown by the wind <br />  
Blown by the wind <br /> 
Oh when I go there <br /> 
I go there with you <br /> 
It's all I can do
