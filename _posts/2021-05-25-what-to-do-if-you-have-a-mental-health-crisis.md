title: What to do if you have a mental health crisis?
---

Things don't always go well. When bad things happen, we can handle them better if we know in advance what they might be and what the possible solutions are.

[This article](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/depression-anxiety-imposter-syndrome/) is a bit long. I spent a lot of time reading it and some of the ideas resonated. 

I list here some key points that may help me or some others get through a difficult situation in life.

Since these are pretty easily fixed, getting some bloodwork to check for iron or vitamin deficiencies might be another really good first step if you think you might be depressed.

> Often the thing to do isn’t even write the email. Sometimes you can literally just write a one sentence email that’s like, “Hey, I’m not going to get to this for a week. I’m sorry,” and that clears the whole thing. The person writes back, “That’s totally fine,” and you don’t have to feel bad about it at all anymore. And nobody was ever upset. And that’s literally all it takes. I think it’s just very easy to miss really quick, huge wins by doing things like that. People understand that you’re busy. Letting them know this isn’t going to come for a while and giving yourself opportunities to see that the person on the other side of it almost never cares as much as you do seems really important to me.
