title: Social interaction can make you happier
---

> Although time and technology marched on, arcades always had a certain charm that couldn’t be replaced by better graphics or central processing units. They were places you could go out of nostalgia, time machines to another era, and, most importantly, where you could interact with like-minded people. This appeal wasn’t limited to traditional gamers; in 2010 Nikkei [reported](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXNASDG0901M_Z21C10A1CC0000/) that arcades were increasingly becoming social hubs for the elderly. One 65-year-old said going to the arcade and making loads of friends was “like being in a dream.”

Read an [article](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2021/06/06/digital/japanese-gaming-arcades-pandemic/) about gaming arcades today. Also have a bit of interaction with unfamiliar people today, which surprisingly lift me up, although I'm still socially awkward and that interaction is also a bit awkward. 

To give it some context, I have some boring tasks to do today, it's also quite mindless, so much so that I can blast rock and roll with earphone while doing the copy and paste. Then came the face to face meeting, which was a bit awkward (so I decided to leave it as abstract as that), but played the magic of lifting myself up. 

I'm still fatigued when typing these words. But at least I'm a little bit elated now, as I was a bit down before that face to face. 

Have been in my new job for about 2 months now. The not so bright side is that the tasks assigned to me can be very mundane. The bright side is that there are more like-minded people around me (or may be I should say people who are as introverted as me and also more excited at the technical instead of the business side of things). There are many hidden geeks here, working at software, some of them are unique in their own way. Some are actually very warm-hearted. Yeah. I want to befriend some of them but I'm too shy. 

At the same floor there's also a design department. I often meet a girl from here on my way to work. She's tattooed on her upper back and a few strands of her hair dyed dark pink. And she smokes. She's different from many other girls, and I know some may disapprove of smoking and tattoo. But I relates to and identifies with her more. At least she dares to express herself. And I think she's sensitive, but she's stronger than me. I'm sensitive, self-conscious, and socially anxious as hell. Don't know how many possible friendships I have missed out on. 

Just imagine if all of us could break the self-imposed fortress and befriend each other. 

Back to the topic. Social interaction can make you happier. Not only face to face meetup can play the magic, online interaction can also be magical, as suggested by *[Video games 'good for well-being', says University of Oxford study](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54954622).*
