It's actually very easy. First, install an RSS reader, such as *Feedly*. Then,  follow the first 3 steps as listed below and you can figure out the rest  without having to refer to further steps.

> 1. Copy the URL of an RSS feed.
> 2. Paste the URL in the Feedly Search box and select the RSS feed from the list of sources.
> 3. Select Follow.
> 4. Select New Feed.
> 5. Enter a descriptive name for the feed.
> 6. Select Create.
> 7. In the left pane, select the RSS feed.
> 8. Select the content you want to read.
