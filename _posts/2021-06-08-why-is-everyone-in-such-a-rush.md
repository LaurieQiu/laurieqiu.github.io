title: Why is everyone in such a rush?
---

[This article](https://norvig.com/21-days.html) is titled "Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years", and it's reassuring to learn some ideas from it, during what could be called a "turbulent" phase in my life.

Here are some excerpts: 

> Hippocrates (c. 400BC) is known for the excerpt "ars longa, vita brevis", which is part of the longer quotation "Ars longa, vita brevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium difficile", which in English renders as "Life is short, [the] craft long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment difficult."

> The best kind of learning is [learning by doing](http://www.engines4ed.org/hyperbook/nodes/NODE-120-pg.html). To put it more technically, "the maximal level of performance for individuals in a given domain is not attained automatically as a function of extended experience, but the level of performance can be increased even by highly experienced individuals as a result of deliberate efforts to improve." [(p. 366)](http://www2.umassd.edu/swpi/DesignInCS/expertise.html) and "the most effective learning requires a well-defined task with an appropriate difficulty level for the particular individual, informative feedback, and opportunities for repetition and corrections of errors." (p. 20-21)

> Fred Brooks, in his essay *[No Silver Bullet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet)* identified a three-part plan for finding great software designers:
>
> 1. Systematically identify top designers as early as possible.
> 2. Assign a career mentor to be responsible for the development of the prospect and carefully keep a career file.
> 3. Provide opportunities for growing designers to interact and stimulate each other.

> [Alan Perlis](http://www-pu.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html) put it more succinctly: "Everyone can be taught to sculpt: Michelangelo would have had to be taught how not to. So it is with the great programmers". Perlis is saying that the greats have some internal quality that transcends their training. But where does the quality come from? Is it innate? Or do they develop it through diligence? As Auguste Gusteau (the fictional chef in *Ratatouille*) puts it, "anyone can cook, but only the fearless can be great." I think of it more as willingness to devote a large portion of one's life to deliberative practice. But maybe *fearless* is a way to summarize that. Or, as Gusteau's critic, Anton Ego, says: "Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere."

> So go ahead and buy that Java/Ruby/Javascript/PHP book; you'll probably get some use out of it. But you won't change your life, or your real overall expertise as a programmer in 24 hours or 21 days. How about working hard to continually improve over 24 months? Well, now you're starting to get somewhere...
