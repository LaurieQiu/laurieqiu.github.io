title: Hedgehog's dilemma

I first learned about [this metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog's_dilemma) when watching *Neon Genesis Evangelion (EVA)*. Recently it just kept recurring in my mind, as I felt like Shinji.

I don’t like Shinji, as do a lot of people, because of his cowardice. But sometimes I just felt that I’m just like him, and could start sympathized with him - Shinji’s cowardice actually stems from his self-loathing and depression.

Although I don’t have trauma as deep as Shinji, I’ve long been facing the same hedgehog’s dilemma. It’s something I’m supposed to fix, but don’t really know how.
