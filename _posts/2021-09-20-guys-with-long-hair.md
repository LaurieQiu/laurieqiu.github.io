title: Guys with long hair

---

Guys with long hair, girls with tattoos, and people who seem eccentric but are comfortable with that...They are cool. As long as what they show is really what they love and believe in.

Sometimes I'm quite quite weak and stressed when I have to deal with all those so called normal people and social situations. What I hate about myself is that I conform, unconsciously, in those situations where I have to participate. But I just can't blend in well. Yeah, just admit that. Just admit that. I can't fake it. And if I said something which is really uncool in retrospect, I just want to destroy myself... I just bend, bend in these situations. Although no normal human beings actually care about what I did, I feel quite quite stressful having to act like normal human beings in situations like that. 

Just like those so-called eccentrics, I'm an ecccentric. Just admit that. People would be taken aback if I really say out loud what I am actually thinking about. 

That marathon, I would not take part in it the second time. Yeah, I would not take part in it the second time. It's not really geeky, and is more like an activity for commerical prototypes, where many people just participate in it to seek attention. Also, new employees have to take part in it with no choice. 

I won't go astray from what I really like anymore. I won't be a traitor. I will stick to that eccentric path. And, if only there's a chance I can be friend with those that I really like. 

Let's see if I can really do what I say. Hope that I don't have to bend to reality to survive.
