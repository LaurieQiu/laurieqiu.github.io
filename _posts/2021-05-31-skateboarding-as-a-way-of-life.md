title: Skateboarding as a way of life
---

I like people who are really into skateboarding, doing it as an expression of their love for life and freedom. I respect their courage.

This year, I have watched a number of skateboarding videos to chill myself out. And here are some quotes from the video *[The Hill Bombing Skateboarders of San Francisco](https://youtu.be/2d6TBfIZzh0)*:

> I definitely am trying to stay alive to the best of my ability. But if there's an easier way to, like kill yourself, it's having a nine-to-five and doing that and, like, drinking beer, and going to sleep, and doing it again, like, you're just killing yourself slower. 

Meanwhile, I also saw a lot of comments below the video reminding skateboarders to wear helmets. Like this one from Jeffrey Speicher: 

> My friend lost half his brain bombing. Very experienced downhill rider. The turning car never saw him. Its been about 20 years since. I think of the guilt the driver must carry. My friends mother who stopped her life to care for him since the day of the accident. And of my friend who's life is forever changed. So stupid not wearing helmets in such an unforgiving pursuit and terrain. I was reckless back then too.

People are very kind. And I wonder if wearing a helmet can be part of the skateboarding culture. It can be the norm and skateboarders can also be bold and cool while wearing helmets. And it also reassures those who care about them. 

Sometimes, maybe we just need to get the balance right.
