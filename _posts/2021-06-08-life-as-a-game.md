title: Life as a game
---

I read [an article](https://www.notboring.co/p/the-great-online-game) several days ago, and some of the ideas kept lingering in my mind: 

> The *Oxford English Dictionary* defines a video game as, “A game played by electronically manipulating images produced by a computer program on a television screen or other display screen.”
>
> If you’re working remotely from a computer, what you’re doing perfectly fits the definition of a video game. 
>
> Nik Milanovic nailed it:
>
> "Sometimes it's weird to remember that we're all effectively competing to hit the right keys on our keyboards in the right order, and that if we do it for long enough we can buy a house."
>
> Hit the right keys in the right order, make money. Work is just an often boring sub-game within the meta-game.

And this reminds me of Buddhism, which holds that things are a reflection of our own mind, and there isn't really boundary between us and the everything in the world. More often than not we are just trapped by our own thoughts, our own mind.

I wonder, if I can take it all as a game, or as a reflection of my own thoughts, would I be happier, less stressed, and kinder? 

All I know for now is that it's easier said than done. For starters, we need to combat our selfish instincts, which is essential for survival, all the time. Some of the theories just kind of go against with that.
