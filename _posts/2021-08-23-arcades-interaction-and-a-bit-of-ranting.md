title: Arcades, interaction, and a bit of ranting
---

Read an [article](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2021/06/06/digital/japanese-gaming-arcades-pandemic/) about gaming arcades today. 

> Although time and technology marched on, arcades always had a certain charm that couldn’t be replaced by better graphics or central processing units. They were places you could go out of nostalgia, time machines to another era, and, most importantly, where you could interact with like-minded people. 

Also have a bit of interaction with unfamiliar people today, which surprisingly lift me up. 

To give it some context, I have some boring tasks to do today, it's also quite mindless, so much so that I can blast rock and roll with earphone while doing the copy and paste. Then came the face to face meeting, which was a bit awkward (so I decided to leave it as abstract as that), but played the magic of lifting me up. 

This somewhat proves the point in the arcade article: social interaction can make you happier. 

And some good news for the shy people guys: not only face to face meetup can play the magic, online interaction can work magic too, as suggested by *[Video games 'good for well-being', says University of Oxford study](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54954622).*
