title: When the night sets in
---

It's great. 

It's like your brain lights up and all your ideas are flowing.

It's quiet. 

You can just immerse yourself in the things that engage you. 

It's cool.

That coolness is comfortable. You are seldom distracted by the heat at night. 

It's like a haven. 

Like, you can escape the mundane, practical daytime things in the dark.
