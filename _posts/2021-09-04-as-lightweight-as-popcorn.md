Here's a quote from bill wurtz. I would just leave his name and quotes like that as he prefers lower case.

Being lightweight mentally is a bless. The equivalent of this should be "carefree". 

I'm feeling much much better now. Guess the hardest part have gone. Now I have enough autonomy and a much clear direction of where to go.

As for where to go, here's another quote from bill wurtz.
