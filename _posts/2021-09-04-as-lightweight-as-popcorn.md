Being lightweight in spirit is a bless. The equivalent of this should be _carefree_. 

I'm feeling much much better now. Guess the hardest part have gone. Now I have enough autonomy and a much clearer direction of where to go.

As for where to go, here's another quote from bill wurtz.

P.S. bill wurtz always uses lower case.
